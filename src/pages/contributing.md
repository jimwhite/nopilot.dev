# Contributor Guide

"Nopilot" was created to help coordinate multiple independant projects that are already underway. To help with clarity, we are working on an overall contributor guide and status page.

In the mean time, you might start by familiarizing yourself with [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com), and looking through the current GitHub [issues](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/issues) for OpenDevin.
