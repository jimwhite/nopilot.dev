3 Weeks Ago, the stealth startup Cognition announced an astonishing demo called [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin), reigning in the next generation of AI coding tools.

That announcement was a shockwave that mobilized thousands of developers around the world, scrambling to recreate that result as Open Source.

Amazingly, with their [efforts](https://mender.ai/blog/we-can-beat-devin) combined with research released in the last week from [Princeton](https://swe-agent.com) and [NUS](https://github.com/nus-apr/auto-code-rover), that has effectively been achieved, the playing field is now level.

What is needed now? Direction. In the tradition of [StackOverflow](https://youtu.be/i0GJqYTPYKU), we will create the tools needed for this community to collaborate and thrive, turning this flash mob into a movement.

That movement will shape the future of software in the open.

*See you there* :)
