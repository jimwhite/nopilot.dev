My Mender.AI article: [We Can Beat Devin](https://mender.ai/blog/we-can-beat-devin) laid out two criteria by which members of the Open Source community are currently trying to "Beat Devin" in friendly competition.

1. Reproduction of a similar UX (user experience)
2. SWE-bench score of 13.8%

It now appears that the second criteria has been met, even quicker than expected! SWE-agent by Princeton NLP and National University of Singapore
